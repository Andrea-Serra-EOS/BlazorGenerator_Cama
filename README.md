# BlazorGenerator
You create the models and BlazorGenerator will create the pages!
All the components are made from Microsoft Fluent UI. 


# What types of UI handle?
 1. List Pages
 2. Card Pages
 3. Worksheet Pages
 4. Two List (side-by-side) Pages
 5. Auto-add menu via Attribute
 6. Actions: functions decored with the "PageAction" attribute will be shown as buttons on the pages
 7. GridActions: functions decored with the "PageAction" attribute will be shown as buttons on datagrid rows
 8. Custom razor page: just use razor normally!
